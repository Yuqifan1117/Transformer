Why Pay More for Fairness?	为何为公平多付钱？
The new Enterprise Bankruptcy Law redefines its scope of application to preclude overlap with other laws like the Social Security Law and the Labor Law.  Indeed, resettlement of laid-off SOE employees, and other social implications of layoffs, should now be addressed primarily by government through the social safety net, rather than as part of the bankruptcy process.	新《企业破产法》重新界定了其适用范围，从而消除了其与其他诸如《社会保障法》和《劳动法》相重叠的部分。 事实上，国企职工下岗的再安置，以及下岗带来的其他影响现在都主要由政府通过社会保障体系来处理，而不是作为破产程序的一部分来处理。

But the US also needs to think carefully about its own actions.	但美国也要对其自身行为进行审慎的考虑。
